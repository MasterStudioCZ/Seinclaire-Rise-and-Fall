**Seinclaire: Rise and Fall** is a mod for Game Dev Tycoon that adds many new platforms based on computers released by the British company Sinclair Research and American company Timex Corporation. It also contains a few platforms based on several spiritual successors of ZX Spectrum, like ZX Spectrum Next and SAM Coupé.

 ![A screenshot, with an example news report.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MasterStudioCZ/Seinclaire-Rise-and-Fall/refs/heads/main/previews/g04.png)
* 46 detailed news reports, capturing both triumphs and failures of Seinclaire Research and others.
# Plans
* Czech translation!
* An extension mod which will have this one as a dependency. It will add many new clones of Sinclair devices; however, these ones will be unofficial. They'll also mostly have one problem (see section *Notes*, point 3)...
# Notes
* Names in this mod are changed in order to fit with other platforms in the base game and to avoid copyright infringement
* This mod contains A LOT of news reports, mostly in the early game (cca each 3 - 4 months). If you don't like reading and just want to play, disable auto-popups for platform news (in Settings, section Messages)
* Several platforms (usually the ones that didn't do very well, including the infamous ZX Spectrum Mega+) have so low marketshare that creating profitable games for them will be very difficult. But alas, that's the price one has to pay for realism...Consider it as some sort of hard mode :D
* As this mod is licensed under GPLv3, you are free to create your own mods based on this one. However, it must be also released under GPLv3!

I hope you'll enjoy this mod of mine!
